# syncCopy

sycnCopy allows for a canonical representation of strings to be managed in a json file that can be used by anyone to keep all design and development artifacts in sync.

Currently text must be managed as a json object (example coming soon) though YAML is the preferred format due to simpler management and readability.

The long-term goal of this plugin is to enable those responsible for copy to maintain in a simple format and ensure all consumers of copy have the latest version at any given time.
